## Day 3
Since there seem to be so many "rules" that can all have an impact, 
but that you might **not** want to apply in a hardcore fashion all the time.

It got me thinking of maybe representing all different aspects of a pokergame

_i.e. chips, their denominations, their value, their actual value, the buy-in, the amount of players, ..._

as rules (within a ruleset maybe).

So that you can enforce or "impose" (softer) these rules.

So maybe I start over, yes?

Like, keep the classes but assemble them out of rules.

## Day 2
Struggling with which problem to solve.

Because there are so many approaches.

For every problem scenario there's usually a couple of knowns and one to many unknowns.

Either you know your small and big blind denominations and want to play with these, no matter what buy-in.

Or, you know the buy-in and care about the speed of your game.

Speed is controlled by the amount of big blinds you get for your buy-in.
A high amount of big blinds will lead to a slower paced game and vice versa.

Or, you know the buy-in and what your ideal small and big blind denominations are, but you don't know which chips out of your pokerset are best to use.

I did some reading and learned that **in tournaments** you need to provide your players with a stack that is good for 50 big blinds in return for their buy-in.

## Day 1
Set out to code a program that helps me make nice Stacks for when we host poker nights.

I recently bought a new pokerset (a bigger one), which has way more different kinds of chips than the one I previously had. And it feels wasteful not to use them all in our game.
